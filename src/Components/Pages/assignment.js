          This assignment tests your analytical, technical and user experience
          skills. The topic for your assignment must be agreed with your tutors.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The assignment should be between 4,000 and 6,000 words. You may use
          tables, diagrams, screenshots, code and images to explain your work
          clearly and concisely.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Please make sure that{" "}
          <a href="http://www.bbk.ac.uk/registry/policies/documents/assessment-offences-policy.pdf">
            you do not plagiarise

        <p>
          The assessment for Web Development and User Experience is divided into
          two parts:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Submission of user experience project documentation (50% weighting)
          </li>
          <li>Submission of Web pages and analysis (50% weighting)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This assessment tests your analytical, technical and user experience
          skills. The topic for your assignment must be agreed with your tutors.
        </p>
        <br />
        You may use tables, diagrams, screenshots, code and images to explain
        your work clearly and concisely.
        <br />
        Submission of user experience project documentation (50% weighting)
        <br />
        In this assignment you will produce a detailed functional specification
        document for your project. It will describe:
        <ul>
          <li>user and business requirements</li>
          <li>the proposed information architecture</li>
          <li>your chosen evaluation methods</li>
          <li>project plan and costing</li>
        </ul>
        Submission of Web pages and analysis (50% weighting)
        <br />
        You will then use the information in your functional specification to
        mock up and develop two sample pages for your Web site.
        <br />
        Your assignment must demonstrate that you have a clear understanding of:
        <ul>
          <li>user-centred design</li>
          <li>information architecture</li>
          <li>Web usability</li>
          <li>Web standards</li>
          <li>HTML and CSS</li>
          <li>accessibility</li>
        </ul>
        Your assignment should be fully reviewed by you to ensure accuracy,
        consistency and completeness. It should be in a form that presents a
        professional approach - well presented, succinct and lacking in
        ambiguity. You should show evidence of original user research,
        evaluation and iterations in design that address the findings of the
        research and evaluation. You should critically discuss and correctly
        reference your source materials.

        Assignment Deliverables
        <br />
        Submission of user experience project documentation (50% weighting)
        <br />
        Your assignment submission must contain:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Your <strong>functional specification document</strong>, which will
            cover the following topics:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>User research and business objectives:</strong> Explain
                the business objectives for your chosen project. Describe your
                target users and their needs. Critically discuss your approach
                to user research in contrast to other methods. Explain how you
                aim to bring user needs and business objectives together as an
                overall value proposition with specific site goals. Critically
                review some similar sites and describe what you can learn from
                them.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Design:</strong> Document the proposed information
                architecture of your site by using appropriate techniques,
                showing the overall structure (site map), specific task flows,
                as well as the individual pages (wireframes). Critically discuss
                how you solved the design problem on a conceptual as well as a
                detailed level. Justify your solution both in terms of user
                needs and usability principles. Define content requirements.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Testing:</strong> Describe how you tested your design
                and critically discuss your chosen approach and its relative
                strengths and weaknesses in contrast to other methods. Describe,
                discuss and prioritise your findings and show how they will be
                reflected in the final design. You may choose to test your
                design with users, or use an inspection technique. Either way,
                you need to explain and justify your approach considering the
                theoretical background as well as the practical application.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Project planning:</strong> Include a high level project
                plan that describes the different project activities and
                timeframes, resources and costs.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Submission of Web pages and analysis (50% weighting)
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>Your assignment submission must contain:</p>
          <li>
            <strong>Mock-ups</strong> of your home page and one other page of
            your site. The mock-ups can be drawn by hand or digitally. They
            should include:
            <ul>
              <li>Global navigation</li>
              <li>Local navigation (if appropriate)</li>
              <li>Title and headings</li>
              <li>Footer information</li>
              <li>Any other appropriate navigation tools</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>HTML code</strong>, produced using Brackets or another
            similar editor, for your home page and one other page. Including
            HTML comments.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CSS code</strong>, produced using Brackets or another

          <li>
            <strong>Supporting documentation</strong> describing the design and
            development of your sample pages. The documentation should
            demonstrate your understanding of Web standards and your wider
            reading
          </li>
        </ol>
        <SubTitle subtitle="Milestones" />
        By Saturday, Oct 13 2018 (WDUX03) you must have selected a topic for
        your assignment project. The requirements are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The project should be specific enough to cater for a{" "}
            <strong>well-defined audience</strong> with{" "}
            <strong>specific needs and interests</strong>. Avoid a project that
            is too large in scope to be successfully realised or has an audience
            too vague to design for.
          </li>
          <li>
            You should have easy access to project stakeholders for interviews
            designed to elicit <strong>business objectives</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>functional requirements</strong> for the Web site. If the
            project is for you (for example, a Web site for your sole trader
            business) then you should be able to articulate the{" "}
            <strong>objectives</strong> and <strong>success criteria</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            You should have ready access to at least 5 or 6 research
            participants that represent the
            <strong>target audience</strong> for the Web site. These
            participants must be available for interviews, which, at a minimum,
            can be conducted by phone, but face-to-face is best. These
            interviews are to develop an understanding of the needs and
            attitudes of your target audience.
          </li>
          <li>
            The project should have a level of{" "}
            <strong>technical complexity</strong> that can be achieved during
            the course.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Please discuss your chosen project with the tutors during WDUX03.
        <SubTitle subtitle="Milestones 2" />
        By Saturday, Nov 10 2018 (WDUX05) you need to have answered the
        following questions:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Who is the client and what are the client's objectives for this
              project?
            </strong>
            <p>
              Make a list of things that the client wants to achieve through the
              project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Refer back to the slides and the reading if you are unsure how to
              do this.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Are there any other stakeholders in the process? If yes, who?
            </strong>
            <p>Conduct a stakeholder analysis. Build a communication plan.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What is the value proposition of your Web site?</strong>
            <br />
            That's like a mission statement for your project. Sum it up in one
            sentence. It should contain the following components:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>What:</strong> What is the site?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Who:</strong> Who provides it and who is the audience?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>How:</strong> How does it deliver value to the user and
                the business?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              For example: anaesthesia.info is a Web site for the NHS (client)
              that informs concerned patients (audience) about different types
              of anaesthesia (topic) by providing a wiki with frequently asked
              questions (features).
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't just stick to this example format; come up with a format
              that fits your project. Don't aim for perfection first time - you
              may discover that your value proposition changes as you do your
              research.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Who is the target audience for your site?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Look at the target audience and how the needs of different visitor
              types differ. Define different types of users and their
              anticipated needs, and where you think you need to do more
              research.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>
                What are the objectives of your user research? What do you want
                to find out about your target audience?
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Define research objectives as bullets; the "known unknowns". Be
              aware that these may change as you start your research and you
              might discover some "unknown unknowns".
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>
                Research the market for your site? Are there similar sites,
                competitors or sites you can draw ideas from?
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>Review for common features and content, and any good ideas.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        A few tips:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Keep a journal of your research, ideas and decisions to aid your
            memory and document your research and design progress.
          </li>
          <li>
            Write things up as you go along to make your final assignment
            easier. Write down findings, people you talked to, processes, issues
            you had conducting your research. Remember that the reader of your
            assignment may know nothing about your project.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't start making shiny objects at this stage: substance is more
            important than presentation.
          </li>
          <li>Don't be afraid of asking more questions!</li>
          <li>
            Don't be afraid of failure! Finding out that some of your project
            assumptions are wrong is an essential part of the design process.
            This part of the project is about de-risking your project by
            re-aligning your ideas with business requirements and user needs.
          </li>
        </ul>

            <p>
              Look at the target audience and how the needs of different visitor
              types differ. Define different types of users and their
              anticipated needs, and where you think you need to do more
              research. Start working on a basic segmentation by demographics
