      <SubTitle subtitle="Rebekah Cupitt, Lecturer" />
      <p>
        Rebekah Cupitt has a BA (University of Queensland, Australia), an MA in
        Social Anthropology (Stockholm University, Sweden), and also holds a PhD
        in Human-Computer Interaction (KTH Royal Institute of Technology,
        Sweden) specialising in Mediated Communication. Rebekah's research
        focuses on the people who use technology in their everyday lives and the
        socio-cultural aspects of technology relevant to its design. By
        examining the ways in which technology influences communication
        practices in Swedish Sign Language Rebekah's research shows how design
        assumptions and technological objects becomes active and powerful
        participants in performances of deaf (and hearing) identity in
        technology and media-rich organisational contexts. Through taking a
        post-human and anti-normative approach to techno-utopias which often
        haunt human-computer interactions, Rebekah highlights how preconceptions
        and socially-embedded assumptions about the user have important
        implications for design.
