      <h1>Gitter Channel</h1>
      <p>
        Starting the current here, we created a gitter channel that all students
        should join. To be able to join and post messages, you must create a
        GitHub account, which is still free. This form of communication is to be
        preferred for the current year: feel free to post any question of public
        interest in the main channel. Optionally, you can also contact your
        tutors using a direct message (DM), although we discourage such practice
        unless strictly necessary, as it might be the case for
        private/confidential information (like communicating the password for
        your webspace). Note that while this course would not require students
        to master a git related work-flow, it is strongly encouraged that
        students wishing to get a better feel of the modern techniques of
        development consider reading some documentation about it. In this
        regard, we would like to recommend both the introductory class on
        CodeCademy and the most advanced tutorial by Atlassian.
      </p>
      <h1>Mailing List</h1>
      <p>
        We also have a mailing list that all students must join. We will use
        this list to contact you, but you should also use it as a discussion
        forum to help each other with problems you may be having and to share
        details of good resources you have found. To join the list, go to the
        list's Web page and subscribe. (Note that it's a two step process and
        you'll be sent an email containing a URL that you need to follow in
        order to subscribe. Please check your junk mail if you don't receive the
        email.) The membership of the list is restricted and all new members
        must be authorised by the course tutors. To send messages to the list,
        you should email:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>wdux1718@bbkweb.org</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We would prefer all questions to be sent to the above mailing list, but
        if you need to contact the course tutors then you should send a message
        to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>wduxtutors@bbkweb.org</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Only the tutors and administrative staff receive emails sent to
        wduxtutors@bbkweb.org. Please don't email any of the tutors
        individually, but instead always email the above address. You'll get a
        much faster response that way. Although you'll get an even faster
        response if you email the mailing list.
